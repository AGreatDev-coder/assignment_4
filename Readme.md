Python Console Calculator (Six Operations)

Project Title & Description

This is a robust, console-based calculator application developed in Python. Designed as a simple command-line utility, it handles six core mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power (exponentiation), and modulus. The primary goal of this mini-project was to demonstrate proficiency in Python functions, conditional logic (if/elif), user input processing, and essential error handling (specifically for division by zero).

Project Features List

Six Operations: Supports standard arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), as well as ** (power) and % (modulus).

Function-Based Design: Each mathematical operation is encapsulated within its own dedicated Python function for clear, modular code.

User Menu: Provides a clear, numbered menu system for selecting the desired operation.

Error Handling: Includes a try...except block to gracefully manage ValueError (Division by Zero), ensuring the application does not crash.

Installation and Usage Instructions

Prerequisites

Python 3.x (Installed on your system)

Local Setup

Clone the Repository:

git clone [Your-GitHub-Repository-Link]
cd [your-project-folder]

Run the Application:
The code file is named new.py . 

Execute the Python script directly from your terminal or VS Code:

python new.py


Using the Application

When running the script, the application will display a menu listing the six operations (1 through 6).

Select Operation: Enter the corresponding number (e.g., 1 for addition).

Input Numbers: You will be prompted to "Enter first number" and "Enter second number" sequentially.

Result: The application will calculate and print the result immediately, handling errors like division by zero automatically.
